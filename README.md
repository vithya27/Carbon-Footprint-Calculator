# Carbon Emission Calculator

The carbon emission calculator is a web page built using React.JS.

This project was created for the fulfilment of the course requirements for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp.

# Project Description

The carbon emission calculator was built for the purposes of understanding one's impact on the environment while travelling and a way to offset the impact by planting trees. While planting trees to offset carbon emissions is not a perfect solution, it is a positive step towards embracing sustainability while travelling.

The project was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Climatiq API provided the backend data required to perform the calculations. The project is intended to be viewed on both mobile and computer screens.

The following libraries were used to create components in the project:

- React.JS
- React-Hook-Form to create the forms (https://react-hook-form.com/)
- Recharts to produce the bar chart (https://recharts.org/en-US/)
- react-spring to produce the animated numbers (https://react-spring.dev/)
- React Router

# Next Steps

These are some features I hope to implement in the future:

- More categories to account for other travel related factors such as hotel stay
- Dark mode/light mode toggle
- Data storage
